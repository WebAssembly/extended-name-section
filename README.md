# Extended Name Section Proposal for WebAssembly

This repository is a clone of [github.com/WebAssembly/spec/](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/).
It is meant for discussion, prototype specification and implementation of a proposal to extend the
name section with names for labels, types, tables, memories, and globals.

See the [overview](proposals/extended-name-section/Overview.md) for a summary of the proposal,
and a rendering to HTML of the updated spec [here](https://www.scheidecker.net/2019-07-08-extended-name-section-spec/).

Original README from upstream repository follows...

# spec

This repository holds the sources for the WebAssembly draft specification
(to seed a future
[WebAssembly Working Group](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/2017Jun/0005.html)),
a reference implementation, and the official testsuite.

A formatted version of the spec is available here:
[webassembly.github.io/spec](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/),

Participation is welcome. Discussions about new features, significant semantic
changes, or any specification change likely to generate substantial discussion
should take place in
[the WebAssembly design repository](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design)
first, so that this spec repository can remain focused. And please follow the
[guidelines for contributing](Contributing.md).
